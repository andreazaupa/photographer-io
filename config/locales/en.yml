    blurb: >
      Thanks for taking the time to try out the early beta of Photographer.io. All
      feedback, bug reports, or features ideas are very welcome. 


      I want to make this the best and most enjoyable photography community on the
      planet. Improvements are going up all the time and I read every single
      message. If you need help just shoot me a support email/message, or grab me
      <a href="http://twitter.com/robotmay">on Twitter</a>.


      The main goal of Photographer.io is to do away with a lot of the complexity of
      photo sharing sites which essentially cater to a few highly
      popular individuals, making it hard for new users to get noticed. It also
      aims to do away with a lot of the ineffective ranking systems used by some
      sites. You can recommend photos here; a
      recommendation is a finite resource and affects the ranking of a photo over
      time. This is an area I'm keeping a close eye on to ensure that everyone has
      a chance to get their photos seen.
      

      Features coming soon: better uploader, commenting (with a purpose), 
      a more advanced ranking system for photos, and general improvements 
      throughout the site.


      Thanks again for trying out Photographer.io!

      Robert May

        public_collections: >
          Your photographs won't appear to the public until you have added them to a
          public collection! This is to make sure you don't accidentally publish
          images you aren't ready for people to see.
        recommendations: >
          You can recommend photographs from other users. This works similarly to
          'liking' a photograph elsewhere, except that you have a finite amount of
          recommendations you can make per day.
