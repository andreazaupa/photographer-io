            | Free accounts aren't treated like secondary citizens here. Everyone has 
              equal input into how the site works and the direction we take.
              If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or other feedback then we'd
              love to hear it! Send it over to

        article
          h3= "No advertising"
          p
            | We hate advertising, which is why you'll <b>never</b> see it on 
              Photographer.io. The site will soon be supported by subscriptions, and we
              may use affiliate links for camera gear etc in future; but we will never run
              adverts.

          h3= "We make money in an obvious way"
          p
            | There's no hocus pocus here. Subscriptions will be coming soon (and at a
              very reasonable price), and these are how the site will be funded. There
              are no investors, no advertisers, and no selling of your data.

        article
          h3= "Likes are dead, long live the Recommendation"
          p
            | We don't use 'Likes' on Photographer.io. Instead every user can make a
              maximum of #{ISO[:defaults][:recommendation_quota]} recommendations per day.
              A recommendation helps promote the photo on our 
              <a href="/photographs/recommended">recommended page</a> but will soon
              recommend the photo to your followers too.

          p
            | Recommendations should be given out for photos which you think are great,
              not necessarily the ones you love the most; that's what Favourites are for!

        article
          h3= "Our commenting system is different"
          p
            | Comments on Photographer.io work more like threads on a traditional 
              message board/forum; you choose a subject for people to comment on. This
              is aimed to help increase the amount of useful feedback you get, rather
              than "OMG LOVE IT". Comments are only visible to the creator and the photo
              owner by default (and the parent comment's owner if it's a reply). This
              means that you get to choose which comments appear on your photos. They
              are <i>your</i> photos after all; shouldn't you choose what appears
              alongside them?
