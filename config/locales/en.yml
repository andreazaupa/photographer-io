    title: "This is an early stage beta!"
    blurb: >
      Thanks for taking the time to try out the early beta of Photographer.io. All
      feedback, bug reports, or features ideas are very welcome. 


      I want to make this the best and most enjoyable photography community on the
      planet. Improvements are going up all the time and I read every single
      message. If you need help just shoot me a support email/message, or grab me
      <a href="http://twitter.com/robotmay">on Twitter</a>.


      The main goal of Photographer.io is to do away with a lot of the complexity of
      photo sharing sites which essentially cater to a few highly
      popular individuals, making it hard for new users to get noticed. It also
      aims to do away with a lot of the ineffective ranking systems used by some
      sites. You can recommend photos here; a
      recommendation is a finite resource and affects the ranking of a photo over
      time. This is an area I'm keeping a close eye on to ensure that everyone has
      a chance to get their photos seen.
      

      Features coming soon: better uploader, commenting (with a purpose), 
      a more advanced ranking system for photos, and general improvements 
      throughout the site.


      Thanks again for trying out Photographer.io!

      Robert May

        public_collections: >
          Your photographs won't appear to the public until you have added them to a
          public collection! This is to make sure you don't accidentally publish
          images you aren't ready for people to see.
        recommendations: >
          You can recommend photographs from other users. This works similarly to
          'liking' a photograph elsewhere, except that you have a finite amount of
          recommendations you can make per day.
        homepage: >
          The top recommended photographs are put into rotation for the homepage.

          if you think they're worth displaying; this can be done via the public view
          of your photo.

        body: |
          The following are the rough guidelines for uploading your photos to 
          Photographer.io. Following these will help ensure your images appear at their
          best!

          * Currently the only supported format is JPEG/JPG.
          * Use a high quality setting when saving as JPG, as we adjust the quality automatically.
          * It's recommended that you upload images of at least 2000 pixels in their largest dimension. This ensures that no scaling up will happen across the site.
          * The largest image size accessible by the public on the site is 2000px, which is used for the homepage images. It will be possible to opt-out of your images appearing there soon.
          * For individual photo pages the images are displayed at a maximum of 1500px in the largest dimension.
          * You can upload full-size JPGs from your camera; upload quotas are calculated by the number of images, not the size. However it's recommended that you use slightly smaller copies to reduce upload and processing time.
          * The original image you upload is not accessible by anyone but yourself, we generate smaller, optimised copies for use around the site.
